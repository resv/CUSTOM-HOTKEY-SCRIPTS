This script requires AHK (autohotkey.exe) which can be downloaded here: https://autohotkey.com

This is a simple script written by me to automatically type out a long HTML/CSS tag with openings and closings.


***THIS SCRIPT IS A PART OF A BIGGER SCRIPT***
LAUNCHING FCC MODE WILL TRIGGER THIS AHK TO OPEN, GIVING THE USER ALL THE QUICK HOTKEYS THAT THIS SCRIPT WA S DESIGNED FOR.
DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE. YOU SHOULD MODIFY THIS FILE TO YOUR NEEDS.


Highly customizable to set any hot key, delays if needed, and any type of tag or input the user would like.

As I progress into working with more projects, I will be uploading more AHK scripts primarily for myself but anyone else are free to use and modify my code.

**There has been an issue if this .AHK file is in a cloud. The solution would be to make a copy of the code into your local drive. Once in local drive you can delete it and it should be able to run with out any issue from the cloud. A weird bug but until I get more information on why this occurs this is how one should use it if saved on a cloud.
