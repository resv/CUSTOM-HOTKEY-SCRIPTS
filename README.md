My scripts are growing as I add more constantly. You can find them easily by sorting through the folder and you will find a README.md for each script!

Be sure to be familiar with AutoHotkey which can be downloaded here: <a href="https://autohotkey.com">AutoHotkey.com</a>

More details can be found in the README.md located in every sub folder.

Most of these files in this repository are for myself to help me become more efficient during coding and improve my quality of life.
