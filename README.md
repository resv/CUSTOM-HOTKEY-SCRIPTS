My scripts are growing as I add more constantly. You can find them easily by sorting through the folder and you will find a README.md for each script!

Be sure to be familiar with AutoHotkey which can be downloaded here: <a href="https://autohotkey.com">AutoHotkey.com</a>


Most of these files in this repository are for myself to help me become more efficient during coding and improve my quality of life.
